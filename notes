///RELEVANT CHALLENGE NOTES

User Story:
As a certified Prosthetist, I need to conduct the “Timed 10 Meter Walk Test” on my patients and record the results in their medical record.  I want a simple tool to help me conduct the test and create a short text statement about the test results that I could cut and paste into my full Electronic Medical Record system.  

Design Assumptions:
I already know how to conduct the test, so the tool doesn’t need to focus on teaching me about it. The tool doesn’t need to authenticate me or let me pick a patient, so it does not need to be secure. It needs to be easy to use and generate accurate text output.  The front end must be a in web-based technology, preferably React-JS, so that it is compatible with our application suite.
