///RELEVANT CHALLENGE NOTES

User Story:
As a certified Prosthetist, I need to conduct the “Timed 10 Meter Walk Test” on my patients and record the results in their medical record.  I want a simple tool to help me conduct the test and create a short text statement about the test results that I could cut and paste into my full Electronic Medical Record system.  

Design Assumptions:
I already know how to conduct the test, so the tool doesn’t need to focus on teaching me about it. The tool doesn’t need to authenticate me or let me pick a patient, so it does not need to be secure. It needs to be easy to use and generate accurate text output.  The front end must be a in web-based technology, preferably React-JS, so that it is compatible with our application suite.

Features:
- Start and stop buttons
    - or single stop/start button with changing text?
- Time label
    - option to show or hide? for aesthetics or motivational reasons i.e. "We're gonna hide the timer so you can't see but you should try to beat your last time"
- Input for notes
    - look into adding text to clipboard to add a "copy" button
- Flag for with/without prosthesis?
- Save list of records at least locally/per instance
    - Require "submit" button to add record? Or save it autmoatically?
        - Yes, require submit button be pressed because stopping the timer !== successful completion of test and it would be annoying to have to delete the record every time they had to stop the timer for any other reason
- Compare avg times w/wo prosthesis and display x% improvement?
